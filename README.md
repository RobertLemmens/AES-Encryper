# AES Encrypter
:speak_no_evil: A small tool that can encrypt and decrypt messages.

Feeling a bit anxious saving plain text? Encrypt it with a password! Encrypted messages result in a base64 representation of the encrypted message.
When decrypting, only base64 representations are supported to prevent character encoding problems.
